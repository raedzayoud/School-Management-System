## School Management System (Desktop Application)
This project, developed in collaboration with the Higher Institute of Computer Science and Multimedia of Gabes (ISIMG), focuses on creating a School Management System. The system is designed to streamline administrative tasks within educational institutions by providing functionalities such as managing student and teacher records.

### Features:
Graphical User Interface (GUI): Implemented using Java Swing, ensuring a user-friendly experience.
Database Integration: Utilizes MySQL database accessed through JDBC for efficient data management.
CRUD Operations: Supports adding, deleting, and modifying student and teacher records.
Design Phase: Contributed to the design phase of the project using UML (Unified Modeling Language) to ensure a well-structured and efficient interface.

### Technologies Used:
Java Swing: For creating the graphical user interface.
MySQL: Used as the backend database for storing and managing data.
JDBC (Java Database Connectivity): Enables Java applications to interact with databases.
UML (Unified Modeling Language): Used for designing the system architecture and interface.

### Contribution:
I have been actively involved in the development and design phases of the project, focusing on creating a user-friendly interface and ensuring efficient database management. This project has provided valuable hands-on experience in Java programming and database integration, enhancing my skills in these areas.

### How to Use:
Clone the repository to your local machine.
Set up MySQL database and configure the JDBC connection.
Run the application and start managing student and teacher records efficiently.
